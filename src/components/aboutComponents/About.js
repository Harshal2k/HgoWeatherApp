            I am a Full-stack web / Software developer 👨‍💻, specialized in the MERN stack. 
            I am Indian 🇮🇳 by birth and love 💝 developing cool-looking 😎 websites 🕸, Apps 📱, and Softwares 💻 in my free time ⏲ and also learning 📖 about new technologies that emerge with time. 
            This website is also an outcome of my interest 💞 in creating new and interesting things 👷, with a bit of coolness 😘. 
            This website was created 🏗 using react ⚛  as the frontend which is connected 🔗 to firebase 🔥 which serves as a database 🗄 as well as hosting 🏠 for this react website. 
            I am also making use of 'Open weather map API' to get all the weather 🌨 details, 'pigeon map' for displaying the map 🗺 and getting the coordinates 📌, and 'Lottie files' 
            for animated SVG's 💫 used in the websites, apart from this I have made use of many libraries 🏛, API's and technologies 🤖 that have helped in creating this Wonderful 🦚 WEATHER APP ⛅.</p>
